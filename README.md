## Project Title / Headline
🌦️ Weather Forecast & Air Quality Dashboard

## Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive and visually engaging snapshot of the current weather conditions, 
7-day weather forecast, air quality index, and other environmental parameters. 
The purpose of this dashboard is to enable users to quickly assess climate conditions, track air quality levels, 
and prepare for potential weather changes based on reliable forecasts.

## Tech Stack
-> Power BI Desktop – for data visualization and dashboard design.
-> DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs.
-> Power Query – for data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
-> Custom Visuals – for radial gauges, cards, and line charts.
-> File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
-> Data modeling - relationships established among tables.

## Data Sources
OpenWeatherMap API – for real-time weather data.

## Problem and Solution
Problem:
Accessing weather data and air quality information often requires navigating multiple sources, interpreting raw data formats, 
or relying on mobile apps that lack detailed environmental metrics. Additionally, most tools do not provide a consolidated, 
visualized forecast that includes air quality, sunrise/sunset data, and precipitation probability — especially localized to Indian cities.

Solution:
This Power BI dashboard solves that problem by bringing together all critical weather and air quality data into a single, 
interactive visual interface. It consolidates data from multiple APIs, visualizes trends over the week, and provides 
decision-friendly insights for users such as rain chances, AQI levels, UV index, and forecast temperatures — all localized 
to Bengaluru and switchable to other cities. The solution also improves accessibility and readability through modern UI components, 
clear visual cues, and an easy-to-navigate layout.

## Business Impact
📊 Better Planning: Enables businesses and individuals to plan around weather and air quality conditions.
🛡️ Health & Safety: Provides timely AQI and UV alerts to support safer decision-making.
🏙️ Urban Management: Helps local authorities monitor pollution and weather trends for better city planning.
🚛 Operational Efficiency: Supports logistics and event planning by forecasting weather disruptions.

## Key Insights
🌡️ 7-Day Trends: Clear temperature forecasts help identify hot/cold spells.
🧪 AQI Breakdown: Shows pollutant levels (PM2.5, SO2, CO, etc.) in real time.
🌧️ Rain Prediction: Daily chance of rain helps plan travel and outdoor activities.
🌍 City Comparison: Quick comparison of environmental conditions across cities.
